Building Your First React Application (Links to an external site.)
 (Links to an external site.)Technical Requirements

For this project, you will be making a React app using the technologies outlined below. When thinking of an app idea, try to frame the project in terms of trying to solve a "problem" and think about the purpose of the app, who would use it, etc. The problem doesn't have to be anything intense and can be something small and simple! For example:

    Problem: I have a huge enamel pin collection and want to organize it all in one place
    General App Idea/Purpose: An app that allows me to catalogue all my pins by category
    Who Would Use It: Pin collectors

 (Links to an external site.)üî¥ Mandatory to pass:
 (Links to an external site.)MVP - Minimum Viable Product

    Must meet with instructors to get your mid-mod project approved.
    Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process.
    A working built by you, using  JSX
    ‚ùóÔ∏è A git repository not inside the class repo. You can use your pages repo from last class.
    At least 3 components
    The use of States & Props
    At least one Github commit per day.
    Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku We will go over the steps for deployment with Heroku during class. 
    A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc
    Have a link to your hosted working app in the README.md file in your github repo

 (Links to an external site.)Recommended Features (Links to an external site.)

    Include portfolio-quality styling
    Use a CSS framework like Skeleton or Bootstrap
    Inside Your README.md:
        Include User Stories
    Make A New Repo & Setup for Heroku Deployment

    Before you begin coding, we will walk you through creating a new github repo, setting up a basic express server, and deploying to Heroku after the project announcement!

    ‚ùóÔ∏è REMEMBER: For all projects, you will be creating the new repo's on GitHub.  (Links to an external site.)
     (Links to an external site.)Technical Demonstration

    All projects will be presented to the class. Your presentation should be:
        Approximately 5-10 minutes in length
            NOTE: We will be using a timer to keep track and will cut you off at the 10 minute mark, so please prepare ahead of time to make sure your presentation does not go over!
        Shows off all features of the app
        Explains the technical details
        Explains the technical challenges
        Explains which improvements you might make
        Talk about one new thing you learned during this project (can be something technical, or even something more open ended like time management, etc.)

    You will be sharing your app and your code. Be prepared to answer questions from the instructors and other students.
     (Links to an external site.)Meetings with instructors

    Your instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time to approve your project.You will meet with an instructor to get your app idea approved. Be sure to write out what features you will need to build in order to meet MVP and some stretch goal ideas.
     (Links to an external site.)How to Submit Your Project

    You will present your project and show your code to classmates and instructors.

    ‚úîÔ∏è Submit your project github link. (Links to an external site.)
     (Links to an external site.)Where to go for help during project week
        Seek out help online
        Seek out help with your classmates
        Seek out help with our class TA

    IA Hours :
        Will be held at the normal times unless stated otherwise.

 Suggested Ways to Get Started

        Wireframe Make a drawing of what your app will look like in all of the stages of the app(what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like while the player is playing? What does it look like when the player wins / loses?).

        Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style) and brainstorm each component individually.

        Commit early, commit often. Don‚Äôt be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

        Consult documentation resources (MDN, etc.) at home to better understand what you‚Äôll be getting into.

Think about...

        Creativity
        Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

        Code Quality
        Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indentation, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

        Problem Solving
        Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?
